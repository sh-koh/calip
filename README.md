# 🌐 Calip - WIP 

Calip is a CLI tool to deal with networking stuff such as conversion of ip addresses in binary format.
It's a project for practicing my Go skills so there's nothing really fancy, just me learning...

## 📔 Features
- Convert each byte of an IPv4 into binary

## 🔨 Building
You can build it using `go`:
```bash
$ go build .
```

Or you can build it with `nix`:
```bash
$ nix build .#
```
